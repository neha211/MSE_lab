Protocols:
- Declares methods that can be implemented by any class.
- The file is a .h file. There is no implementation file.
- Objects adopting the protocol should implement all the methods in the protocol.
- Implementing multiple protocols is possible


Subclassing:
- Declares and defines methods and variables which can be inherited by other classes.
- Needs both interface and implementation file.
- Need not implement all the methods, in case of non-implementation, the base class method is invoked.
- Multiple inheritance is not allowed.
